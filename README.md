# Arithmetic for Kids

## Why
Because I have a daughter who is 5 years old and is learning arithmetic. Everyday I need to create a test paper with a few questions for her to practice. If you have same need, then please visit the [deployed app](https://arithmetic-for-kids.herokuapp.com) which you could use for free.
